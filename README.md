# Staffing-Levels-EMCC
Determining appropriate staffing levels using Queueing Theory for the Emergency Medical Call Center

The goal of this project is to apply the topics of Applied Stochastic Modeling in real-life situations, in this case to the call center of an emergency medical service (EMS). The aim is two-fold: (i) it shows the practical aspects of applying queueing models to real settings, and (ii) it requires to think about assumptions and performance analysis of different queueing models.
